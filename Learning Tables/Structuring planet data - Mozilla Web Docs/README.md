## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, I practiced structuring planet data using HTML tables. The task involved creating an HTML file named `planets.html` that organizes information about planets in our solar system. The data included details such as planet name, diameter, distance from the sun, orbital period, and number of moons.

## Contents

- `planets.html`: The HTML file containing the table structure and planet data.
- `tables.css`: The CSS file providing styling for the HTML table.
- `planets-data.txt`: A text file containing sample planet data.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `planets.html` file in a web browser to view the HTML table with planet data.
    
Feel free to explore the HTML file and customize it further if desired.
